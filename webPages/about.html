					<span><h3>Our History</h3></span>
					<p><big>F</big>rom the dawn of recorded human history, many issues have sprawled around our globe. A grand one of these, plaging us to this very day. An attempt to immunize our populations in such an organized fashion hasn't yet prevailed. Many in developed countries who seek a chance of success aren't able to. One of these reasons is <em>health</em>. Founded in 2001, Global Vacci Link set out on a path, seeking for personnel worldwide to shift the tides on Global Health crises.</p>
